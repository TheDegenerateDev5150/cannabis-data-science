## Objective

Estimate total cannabis sales per transfer in Michigan over time. The estimate may be able to be used to judge the profitability of transportation companies. If sales per transfer are increasing, then this may indicate increased transportation performance. The average pounds sold per transfer can also be calculated to begin to estimate shipping costs. A crude estimate of `x` pounds per pallet can be used to estimate the number of pallets of cannabis transferred.

### Future work

Explore how zoning may affect transportation costs. Licensees may be forced to locate in less than desireable locations, increasing their transportation costs.
