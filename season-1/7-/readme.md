## Introduction

The concentration of firms in cannabis markets over time is of interest to participants in the cannabis industry, so, we will attempt to estimate a measure of market concentration and see if this measure changes over time.

## Presentation

**Objective** - Estimate the HHI for cannabis cultivators in the Washington state cannabis market in 2019 and 2020 and compare any difference.

## Discussion

During the pandemic, it will be interesting to see if market concentration rose or fell and we could discuss why that may be.
