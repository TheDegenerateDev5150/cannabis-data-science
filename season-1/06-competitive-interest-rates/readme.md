## Introduction

Last week we discussed how to estimate the *real* wage in the cannabis industry. This week we use the same economic model to estimate the rate of return on capital equipment. Cultivators that do not achieve the expected rate of return on their capital may exit the market over time, so, successful cultivators may wish to aim to meet or beat the expected rate of return. In this exercise, we will estimate a crude rate of return for capital in the Colorado cannabis market. This can be useful to cultivators to gauge their performance.

## Presentation

**Objective** - Estimate the rate of return of capital in the Colorado cannabis market.

## Discussion

During the pandemic, it will be interesting to see if the estimated real wage rose or fell and if the estimated rate of return on capital rose or fell. Any change in input costs may cause firms to transition from using more or less labor to using less or more capital.
