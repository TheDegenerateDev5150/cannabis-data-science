## Introduction

Anecdotally, some purchase managers at retail establishments take moisture content into consideration when purchasing cannabis. The moisture content of a product affects it's moisture corrected cannabinoid concentration. So, purchase managers can calculate moisture corrected concentrations to compare products with various moisture contents. The question is, does utilizing a moisture correction factor enable a purchase manager to better predict sales than if a purchaser tried to predict sales on cannabinoid concentration alone.

## Hypothesis

Null hypothesis: There is no statistically significant relationship between moisture corrected THC concentrations and total sales for a product.

Null hypothesis: The correlation between THC concentrations and total sales for a product is not significantly different than the correlation between moisture adjusted THC concentrations and totals sales of a given product.

## Methodology

The outline of the research methodology is as follows.

1. Calculate sales per lab result.
2. Calculate moisture corrected THC concentration for each sample.
3. Estimate a regressions of sales per lab result on the lab result's moisture corrected THC concentration.
