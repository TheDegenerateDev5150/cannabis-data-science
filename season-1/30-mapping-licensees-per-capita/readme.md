## Introduction

This week we begin to analyze the terpene data of the brand analyses in the [Connecticut Medical Marijuana Brand Registry](https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Medical-Marijuana-Brand-Registry/egd5-wb6r/data). We begin by calculating the prevalence of each terpene, that is the percent of samples where the terpene is detected.
