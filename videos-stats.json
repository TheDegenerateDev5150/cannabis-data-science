      "description": "üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In the spirit of discovery, we're donning our statistical hats, plunging into the Massachusetts cannabis industry. Using statistics as our torch, we meticulously inspect cannabis licensee data, with a focus tighter than a well-rolled joint. We traverse through cultivation sizes, scrutinize performance data, and contrast the performance of disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) and non-DBEs. It's a cannabis-centric, statistical soiree where cannabis stats meets real cannabis data. Join us as we spark up some insights.\n\nü§ù Join the fun, data wrangling, and analytics in the Cannabis Data Science meetup, every Wednesday at 8:30am PST | 10:30am CDT | 11:30am EST.\nhttps://www.meetup.com/cannabis-data-science/\n\nüßë‚Äçüíª Find the data and source code: https://github.com/cannlytics/cannabis-data-science\n\nüí∏ Support the group: https://opencollective.com/cannlytics-company\n\nüî• Check out Cannlytics: https://cannlytics.com",
