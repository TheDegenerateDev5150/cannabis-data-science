## 👩‍🔬 About<a name="about"></a>

At Cannabis Data Science meetups, you can learn how to get, wrangle, and analyze cannabis data. You can learn how to utilize the web and APIs to get the data that you need. You can learn how to wrangle the data like a pro into a format suitable for analysis, then calculate statistics to your heart's galore. Furthermore, you can learn how to build forecasting and prediction models to get an upper-hand on your competition. You can join like-minded individuals, learn modern data science techniques, and go through hands-on exercises with real cannabis data. This is a great opportunity for anyone in a cannabis-testing lab, anyone working at a cannabis cultivation or processing plant, any cannabis retailer, and even any cannabis researcher or consumer seeking knowledge. Please join us for a coffee or tea every Wednesday at 8:30am PST / 10:30am CDT / 11:30am EST / [your time](http://www.timebie.com/std/pst.php?q=8.5) for a fun time crunching cannabis numbers.

## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

First things first, you can clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cannlytics/cannabis-data-science.git
```

The majority of examples are written in Python. If you [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html), then you can create a virtual environment with all of the packages that you will need with the following command-line commands.

```shell
conda create --name cds python=3.9
conda activate cds
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be off to the races and able to run most scripts, following any script-specific instructions and downloading any necessary datasets. Please see the data sources below to find datasets used.
