## üöÄ Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

First things first, you can clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cannlytics/cannabis-data-science.git
```

The majority of examples are written in Python. If you [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html), then you can create a virtual environment with all of the packages that you will need:

```shell
cd ./cannabis-data-science
conda create --name cds python=3.9
conda activate cds
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should now be off to the races and able to go through most notebooks, following any notebook-specific instructions to download supplementary datasets.

## üåü Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>

Contributions are always welcome! Please submit issues, questions, bugs, fixes, improved-upon code, or anything at all that you want to be addressed. Anyone is welcome to contribute anything. You can refer to the [Cannlytics contributing guide](https://docs.cannlytics.com/developers/contributing) for more information about contributing to the Cannlytics ecosystem in general.
