Standing to provide. Of our people and far down that we have started, supporting this industrial temp reasons programs and this location. And can take here or we have provided here. Socks not only are the site but also our headquarters to test our idea of materials.

To the learning process and I'm sure we'll have a lot of opportunities.

So, okay. So

Thank you.

Okay. Other couple of logistics things on board here. You have seen there's a couple of clipboards one has an agenda. One has a plot map for the pool. Right. Here we go to equal. Block. And then there's also another sheet which has instructions on how to get through the next location going to be in three locations.

Today, we have to be here. We're going to drive to one of our partner growers farms.

I'm buffered in there, because Over there. There. Signs pulling in right down the road to the middle of the cornfield in the hospital in Alaska. See it? I'll go over there. But then there'll be some parking on the left and we'll go to the right to where the field.

Then we're going to leave from there. We're going to come back to the headquarters and we have 97 headquarters area, which is about three miles that way. And that's where our brain and fiber trials are. So what we've got here, this is what we call an essential oil trial, for core cannabinoid type temp or a terminoic type.

That's know what your targets are. Grown at white facing. We're growing them here in some of the what we now call traditional ways of growing them, where they've got plastic drip irrigation underneath, The class. That it makes it easier to maintain. We have this part and I'll talk about those in What how this adult set up?

The second side, we're going to go to the drawer where the drawing fiber. You've got several three different fiber types things growing. We're going to see what that looks like on a farm. For all of you see that plant are quite a bit taller than these. Then we're going to put headquarters.

We have our greatness fiber variety trial, where we have about 30 different, right? Part of our diversity trial as part of the national germ plasma generation after we'll talk about that. That's we're going to talk about today. There's a couple times. You got to drive here to Passwords restroom.

To look over here, the buildings that you boys have along that little road, which is dried down that there's a little, there's a red thing to have red on it, the day, just like saucing harvesting machine. Right. The left of Another little. That has restrooms here. Okay, that's what we got at this location.

Stacy's Farm, there may be something that his facility right across the road. I'm not sure about that one. So I would suggest if you think you need to go between there and headquarters to go here. Okay? One we get back to headquarters, there'll be the Hamilton. Hall is a big building.

It's got several restaurants in it so you can stop there before we start the next stage there. Everybody else. Somebody always ask about resume, make sure you got that one. Clear questions on that, anybody. Okay, the rest of our time here, we're going to talk about a couple things to talk about test issues disease issues and also about So I'm going to start out, we're going to start, I'll talk about the trial to million, have some things to hand out.

Okay, actually. Are you gonna do that when we walk through? Okay? So let's do that for those who want to grab your bottle of water, which I recommended everybody get a bottle of water. Right here. We're going to walk down. We're going to talk about the variety trails. Yes.

To get your energy back up.

Used.

Here.

That.

At them. Each one is 50 feet long we have 20 right? Thank you. Yeah you're welcome my friends on it. Yeah we got four more and if you look down here Here, we have eight different varieties that we're evaluating here that we drove most of Well. We've got a couple other ones.

Great, most of these are not actually established variety.

Do in our field. Yeah. If you call the state that this first section, all of these were from transplants and putting in a greens and starting feeding, a little pot. So the greenhouse

Is mountain. Okay, so they got a head start before. They came here. The planting date on this drag, it was April 12th class engaged in the field of nature camp, right? And then let's watch this way. Don't have a chance to dance walk through. That you down here, looks a little bit different.

Topic.

The time. So,

Earl. Oh, you don't like my area there?

We look what's going.

Something like that, we were And happy.

It's also watering in water. Like our today's channel. That you live with them, or you can learn how

The other questions about everybody, We wanted to be happy. My name is beloved. We really wanted to be happy. We're not right. Yeah. Right now, the only thing we get,

Right. Yep, I mean, that's what we're using right now. It's what used for

By audience. Pretty much God because it doesn't.

We'll, To take longer to have. But when you go, you got to compare or retail or you know, whatever by the next Getting in front of you. So, the scores of the

Trying to read it. So pretty. Well here it doesn't have to have a very low male. And it has colors and

I'm about creating a video. Yeah, eat plot. The spacing is succeed on center last few years by And we have, Really. Great. But also in the classes, By paying attention.

Waterwheel that. Like the 5.

And they will fill up.

No, each plot is more robust, EA and 8D. Support itself. So I'll change it down there and read, 50 feet long. And we have 11 plans to be doing 11, clients who will row and there's enough gap. We've got to make medical imp.

Printer, you do have to Think we have a lot of them. The classes.

After. Together with our

In that if you know, where you line up, if you like a look, that's We try to get the drip tape right down. And then we're a little bit off to the side. And most of the time this

It's it's city, it's by weight. Great. It. Well, I know I'm planning the one that we have our Get some good smells. Originally got this. Water wheel for ro. And it's got setting. It's got a center where you can actually have an investment double the density. We're only doing it every office.

So you put to a higher density. So we also have it set up. We have two water rules next to each other and we have done that before we offset the plants to be Higher density, we decided not to do that this year to be the last year and decided that

And also the main reasons. To dance. Here.

We have down to the left. Extra. Wow. In the plant. Welcome back. But yeah, one day Remember.

Putting?

Yeah, actually I got my apartment.

The difficulty have. Typical we have are the difficult ones for the conversation. We've got pigweed or polymer amaranth that we've got land supporters, and we've got our lovely lunch. Those three main ones that we have in our field here.

But as you can see that some of these plans, we're all excited the ones over there, they catch up, these were slanted, Later.

Using the catch up a little bit. We're going to If you're how well to do half years of impact as well, but you have to teach and other The figuring that hopefully,

Yet Texas.

But then again, if you're like a clever like we're yesterday, he 70.

And because

Little different though. You guys are doing yeah.

I'm here.

Capital. And it's four ways over the other six foot.

Quarters well instead of a 54 plot. Anyway, and these the ID here is that, they'll fill up, we have had to do some animating. They didn't grow up as fast as we would call. Trying to figure out time and think I need an issue on this. Getting Minnesota at the right time of year, like We and as you walk through you see some of them.

The end plot can do not do as well. Kind of the way it is they get more winds and other things, affecting them. The ones in the middle tend to be a little bit better. Of. So when you get in there you'll see the

I walk inside podcast. Easier for you.

So that Packages.

What a tired? So my information is used with WSU University. They have this great specific age system, it's got some coming up and Also, send out.
