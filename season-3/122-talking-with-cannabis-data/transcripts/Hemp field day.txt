Roll up to my vehicle.

Lunch at the Pendleton extension. And then, I'll Are to the west to. You see? And that will both be a process. And then a additional core how to appeal and if at any point you're feeling like you've had enough for the day years and check out when you are ready but that's a little bit of the plan going forward and

We able to understand. Yeah, we are here.

Wanted to take a break. You can use that one. Yep. Yeah, absolutely.

You all know.

Res. They're very

That's,

Here we go. And that brings me down down to a fair tone, right? In our seat. So again, welcome

About the screen and cooperators and other states again, Thank you and welcome. Thank you so much and thank you so much for your leadership. You know what you are doing? It's great for all of us and I now imagine that we have a, what is in hand? And I parked like with the great idea for us what the greatest coming, you know, in order and I would like to get all these years if you want to talk to me about who you are and what you are doing and what's your role on the commission?

My name is Paul Murdock and what we are doing. We're trying to figure out this market just changing. So radically so myself and Eric. And some of any other events commissioners are here, Of that Christian show that is in classes, natural. And in order to kind of figure out what the landscape is first is expanded with

And so, Also. So we're trying to figure out. My.

Still, very And there is But, Clear.

Quite to figure out what hard job is in part of the past and of cancer in Oregon. So, I'm really pleased to increase the

And by the way, I work, very closely with Paul knows. He's our neighbor. You know, we have a bigger day, you know, communication all about hands to do on anything on an admission. It's gonna ask you something. And everyone can hear me. Hi everyone. My name is Eric Pike.

I've represented business in county and Chris all and I asked you we have seen a heat turn and there have industry and that's when I take a lot of it is the materials aspect of using the hemp license for a legal purp. Our focus is to educate and really turn that around because we see a lot of This is last.

And what we can do with it is not necessarily just for the oil. It's also for fiber and we can go on and on, and on. But most importantly, it decrease structure established compliance and get everyone on the right page. And how do we do that? We actually reach out to our farmer.

And ask them to seek out. Look at us and kind of a beacon to help them through organization compliance issues with problems. I think that for us as you know, the information is just about it is all about their coming together and creating the community to come on us all these people here so that we can create more of an education purpose, and we can do something for the plan that Has an extension that we can see some or two at this landsc.

Thank you. Very,

Thank you guys.

Regional farmer.

How?

To. The. And,

But,

For that. That's one of the biggest things I can do now here.

Great.

Of allowing the different global varieties that are out there and that comes in a bit.

Was a lot of things that we can do. There's a lot of as

We all kind of thinking different backgrounds because we have connectivity.

What people do with your family and always interested? How do you manage like you know fiber in the flower type That's enough that we're gonna get that. Thank you, Go ahead and for our next stop, it's going to be checking out our dry land temp, squads out of this field.

You can see their dark away But I'm going to have Head. Me. And when to arrive there, grab a plot bounce from the window. Take a brief look and one minute later, Don and I will arrive with the microphone and let's tell you about what's happening after. So, grab a water, all of them.

Yeah. Okay. You're right. Yeah.

Into installing. Has population is autonomous with the OSU extension service. Don is our local host and is the responsible for these kept plots, and the next section of our agenda, Thank you, Gordon. I hope all you have a pop plan like you says, I'm done with hockey extension. Soil.

Sinus, we actually been working with hemp about four years. The very first year, we get some hemp files that all the legal issues were not worked out. And we had to do describe the crop as soon as it started to flower, like all that agronomy by attorney.

Feeling good. There's a company in Montana, IND Hampton. They were gonna send a representative here. Unfortunately, they're doing a field day in Montana today, but this is the goal for hemp field days, I guess. And we worked with IND hemp. They actually contract grain hemp in the Pacific Northwest in Montana.

We had a goal near Dixie Washington that we worked with Michael Lyon. We watched his crop one year. We actually had a trial before it was legal to grow. Here, we are going in Washington. So we're sneaking across the border and planting trials in Washington the last two years we've done trials like this.

Last one where that Approach truck is that was our last year's file. This is this year's trial. There's two experiments here. We have this experiment, post to me. And, and the signs, indicate the nitrogen rates But this is x59 graham. It's an autoflower type, which means you planting and grows and it ripens it Steven can explain more than then I can that this stuff grows up quickly.

It's 90 a hundred day, crop, maybe longer sort of depends how much water you get. But this is a nitrogen, great trial with x59 grain hemp and my interest is highly in this drain hip because this would fit into our coughing system. It's a spring cough, we can plant it, we can harvest it, like we or other grains and you you cut this and you get the seed and that goes into human food and there's people here a lot more experience and knowledgeable.

It can explain all that part to you. This x-59 here. We planted on the 12th of May. Okay, and we, we're anticipating rain this year. That was a mistake. So 12 to me, we came out here in the moisture. Was that deep? And so it to make a choice, do we wait and have it dry out more or we hope it rains.

Well, we decided that our best hope was to plant who we came out here and planted this, drop about an inch and a half deep, which is, you know, three quarters of an inch more than anybody recommends. But it was dry loose soil. We got it into moisture. We put a good press on the, on the seed row and I was happy with the stand we received.

I'm pleased with this.

Since we planted, Two days in May we got a quarter inch of rain. Three days in June, we got like, four tenths two camps, three, ten. So there's about a third of an inch of rain on this since we planted Yeah, and if you look at that plot plan diagram, they put the crop year precipitation, which we measure from September 1 till now, 10 and a half inches of rain, since September, that's about six inches below with.

The average here would be. So we're about 70% 65% of normal. So, you know, I don't know what, you're definition of drought is that. Now, this is a dry year for spring frog. And so, what we have here, His x-59. There's five rates a nitrogen. There's zero nitrogen. And then we have a zero with phosphorus pressed sulfur.

And then all of the nitrogen rates have phosphorus and sulfur. Also. So we have a true zero one that if sulfur phosphorus would be deficient, we would see that in the check zero and then all of them receive that. So those other two elements are not short. You know, I want to supply those.

So the only thing that we look at is nitrogen, so we have zero 50 100 and 200 pounds of nitrogen. By contrast, this with our trial. Last year. This year, I said we got a quarter inch in. May, anyone on a guess what we got last year? In May?

There's a nearly a record. A high record. We got over five inches of rain in May last year and part of what this crops going on is last maze preset. So if if you would have been here last year, this sounds like a fishing trip. Every time I go fishing.

Oh, you should have been there yesterday. There were biting. Okay, you should have been last year here last year, because the hamp was this tall last year at this time. So, you know, this is a difference between five inches of money and a quarter inch in May. If I look at this cough, the way we apply this nitrogen, it's applied below the row.

We actually you'll use our pot drill as an applicator. So we put the fertilizer down below the row. Make a pass, put it in, so it's precise and every font and then we come back over that and see it. So we place a nitrogen about that. The seed goes about that.

And when I look at this, I can see some response to nitrogen and I can see no response. But this is why we do multiple years of research. Last year, we had a dry year here. What year and somewhere around a hundred pounds. The hundred pound rate was the optimum rate.

I don't know what's going to be optimum, but I will take bets that it won't, it won't be a hundred. It's going to be those lower rates because we got to match it with the water that's available. So that's this is why we do multiple years of research. And I most interested in this green hip Canada has a green himpian through industry, they've had green ham industry since the early 1990s, and I made friends with some Canadian colleagues, and I've learned more from the Canadians about this than anywhere else because they, they have the experiment.

They got 30 years experience, growing this crop And how it's good to have the Canadian connection. I'm trying to talk Jeff into organizing a field trip for us to go to Canada. This camp. I mean fishing. No, I mean him. There's a question.

Okay, I'm gonna repeat that questions. He's asking about the optimum elevation and and rainfall for This hemp crop and you know, there's a bunch of experts here better than the night after that question, that I'll give you my answer and then may I'll hand it. The mic to Steven over there.

For us, the elevation here is about 1500 feet and to me there would be varieties that would be suited for different elevations and and, and different rainfall regimes and Stevens job is to breed all these varieties for all these environments that I'm gonna hand the mic to him and Do you hear that?

He said, I made it. Perfect. The checks in the mail, Another question. So you've got half a dozen. Different bridles and trial here. But yeah okay, yeah, my questions gonna be what about cross pollination with the different varietals and see production.

In this case, we're not worried about cross-pollination because this is just a trial to see what the the plant can do. But if you're really talking about cross pollination, we can't take fiber and grain types into southern Oregon. We can't go to the laminate valley because we're not going to make any friends.

People are going to be really pissed off that we were blowing that much pollen across the country. So yeah, but we're isolations for breeding. We have to be pretty careful about where we put those using. The ODA map that shows all the farms that that have that are growing hip at that time, we make sure that we're as far enough away from them, that we don't, we don't pollinate them.
