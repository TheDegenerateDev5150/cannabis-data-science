Because they have all kinds of different plans that we got. Hundreds of thousands of excessions are in that collection. If you are interested in any kind of proper example, the phase the old. Would mean I know this one. They got about this 40,000. I think accessions. Now, you're in Poland Washington, where do you think any kind of beans?

They got it there grasses. Same thing. It's in Poland. Yeah, isn't even New York and that's where Tyler, and Zach. Spencer are two partners. There are. And we've been working with them to try to reestablish. There was a collection for our number of years till the 1970s. This thing called the War on Drugs started, and the gym closet collection was a, it was destroyed.

Nobody knows exactly what happened to it, but it's gone. So, we're trying to establish that what we're doing is, we're valuing different excessions of difference. All different types of hand, from rain fiber to chemical hemp, and they are being grown in different fields. Very much like this one, across the country, we're evaluating their growth parameters properties.

The quality of the fiber of the seed, and the cannabinoids interpoloids and other compounds that they make. So we have Good information about all these different accession to be available and time about that On this side. I'll talk about the later. This is our brain fiber trial Last year.

When we grew this up, in the fellow, almost all the plants were as tall as the shortest of you or taller than me. They were they did exceptionally. Well This year, we had an issue where nobody told us this, but people that grew hops here before us decided before they left that they would scorch earth the field for us and put a nice.

Germination, inhibitor on it. Who has a lifetime of about 18 months to two years and we planted our plots. We have a 120, something of them, different varieties replicated. And this end is all the grain varieties and a dual crop which is very fiber. That happens at the fiber.

Variety and our energy came up and we were really puzzled. We thought we messed up on the planting. We looked at it, it was a little bit dry to soil. It's very, very sandy. We thought we had an issue with it. Just being too dry, we planted not packed.

Well, so we redid it. We made sure was all really wet. This is gonna feel was a really great condition dragon. Put a lot of effort into making. Sure it was ready. We planted again. It looked great. And it looks the same and then we try to figure out what's going on and that's moved out that this stuff called eleon and other stuff called shadows sprayed on the field.

And it doesn't wonderful job of this event against from Germany. The good news about our sack trial, those were all germinated in pots and the greenhouse, they were nice transplants. Those two herbicides are germination inhibitors. They do not forget the plastic brewing what's they're up. So those plants are doing just fine but our grading fiber trial where we planted this two different densities that about 680,000 per acre or 1.3 million plants per acre.

That was our densities, they didn't do very well. Some of them did okay in their spots where the before you see the best growth of the plants, that's where the pop lines were made in spray. Where the house were they just sprayed in between them anyway. So we're looking interesting there.

Hemp seeds are very much like other seeds if you give them the wrong over side or around treatment, they don't have anything like it. So we're still hoping that we'll get something out of this and we'll grow and we'll get some information about it. It's definitely not what we're hoping for this year.

The good news. Is this try over here? Looks like it's gonna be Just like we were happy anyway. So for now if you look at the jamba oh I have two maps there. One is for the sack trial sack is this one over here they have fiber is just over here you'll have some time where you have lunch.

If one o'clock we've got an hour, we're gonna turn the time over right now. High reverse we talked about the sack child. Then we're gonna hear from Corby mid toe who is a supplier of seeds from Austintown warehouse. It's milky USA. These provide us with the hemoglobin for cramps.

Maybe we found two bro. Really? Well that includes the ones we decided So, it would reduce

All right. Thank you very much David for inviting me. Afternoon, My name is Tyler Gordon and I'm with the USDA ARS in Geneva, New York, It's David Neptune. The unit there is called a plant genetic resources unit. And we actually have several several different kinds of collections. So, we have the Apple collection there.

Also cherries, cold hearty, great. And then a whole bunch of different vegetables, including graphic collection, onions, some squash and, and recently him, which I was surprised about that USDA is going to support him conservation, but but we are. And so we're part of a larger network called the national Plant germ, plasm system and it it composes about 20 different locations, spread throughout the US.

And each of those locations has specific crops that they acquire conserve and then evaluate and then distribute freely to not only people breeders and researchers in the US. But also globally to many countries throughout the world. And so our goal with the USDA areas in in Geneva, with this temp, collection is to do the same with him as is done for many other products.

So that's acquiring serving, evaluating and distributing seats and and for him there's one caveat we'll only distribute regulatory compliant, USDA regulatory compliancies. So those are Excessions that have less than three percent yet THC. And so if your greater or, you know, breeders that are interested in temp, please let them know about us.

They can get in touch with me or my first colleague that stencil of the curator and we can we could try to arrange a seed distribution to those folks. And so I want to talk just a little bit about each of those steps that are very important to the germ, plasm system generally and so the soil, let me go back a little bit and say like why is germ plasm protection and conservation.

So important any does anyone want to venture? Why why am I why might these questions be so important to breeders and agriculture? Yeah of course national security. Yeah yep and food security exactly so As an example, someone was talking earlier today, a couple people mentioned a virus in in him.

So hemps kind of relatively new crop, especially off in the field. So you get a new virus in through through agriculture, through these air cultural production systems. And so, the first place that researchers turn off in are these collections looking for resistance? And also, as you know, as the climate is, it's changing.

And we're seeing different regimes for irrigation or water needs and temperature needs these germ. Plasm collections are some of the first places researchers and breeders will turn. So look for those unique alleles or unique air plasma accessories. Yes, can respond to low enough irrigation or high temperatures. And so we want to acquire as you know as much diverse germ.

As we can and then do, you know, evaluate that term plasma as well as? All? Right, now there's about just over, 400 accessions, 400 epic sessions in the collection, and those accessions come from all over the world, we just got access to a big collection out of IPK after slave in in Germany.

And also, we're working with partners in check republic, to get some of their temperature plasma as well. And so that's what as a USDA entity, we're able to kind of work with some of these other other collections in other countries to to try to facilitate Germ, plasma coming into country.

And so, from an acquisition point of view, I think, you know, we're doing as good of job as we can, but we, we also want to come to meetings like this grower events and an alert. The public that. Yes, we're looking for germ, plasm, we'll take any kinds of seeds.

So if you know, people that are interested in donating to a collection, please let us know. And then so the next part of of our mission is doing the evaluation so conservation. I guess is the next thing. Maybe I'll talk about that a little bit. So we have facilities to store this term, plasma very cold temperatures.

So we have a pretty extensive storage facility that we can storage our plasma like at minus 20 degrees C. In special envelopes that allow for long-term storage especially where hemp is high in oil content. It's important To have these like very special storage conditions for long-term storage and distribution.

We're also growing. So oftentimes we'll get just a small amount of season. Like in a couple cases it's like five seats and so we need to have a way of increasing those seats. So we have several growth chambers, we're able to grow each of these populations as it comes in.

We can prioritize those and grow them in these businesses. And then once we grow them out, then we have enough seeds that we potentially distribute to breeders. And then for the evaluation, David mentioned that we are working with series of different universities, including Washington State, Oregon State, UC Davis, and then recently Louisiana State University, and Alabama, and our cited Geneva, New York.

And we're trying to find as many different kind of diverse locations to test this germ plasm as it comes in so we can see, you know, what kind of germ plasm does well in different environments and then we get a little better idea of environmental interactions with the with the genetics of those specific sessions and see where we're looking for kind of like higher edibility or a breeder.

Would look for something like that worth stable across different sites. And so we're kind of we're also kind of looking for additional sites as well, if you know, folks that are interested. And so this is a great demonstration plot right here that David pointed out. These there's probably more than 30 different accessions here and when I say accession it's not it could be a cultivar.

That's what a lot of people think about is that an accession is equal to our. But in some cases, they're more of a population. Like in in several instances, what we got was like a package of seed from like a county in Iowa. They and so we call that.

Here's it an accession. But it's clearly just a population from that region. And so we treat the accessions generally is as populations and they are quite. I was talking to several folks. Earlier the accessions aren't very heavily. And so there's a lot of variability within each of these exceptions as they're outposts.

So, we do this value, we do these evaluations, we're looking for plant architecture. So how tall the plants get when how another important metric to us is like how wide they get in these white space plantings. We're trying to get pictures of all the plants, and we're also looking at flowering and sex ratio, so him is primarily dioecious.

So there's no females. But there's also one issues plants as poorly may talk about later. And so, we're trying to record all that information in addition, we're looking at fiber quality where some needs samples down to one of our partner labs at USDA is called it southern regional agriculture center down in New Orleans and they they work on cotton fiber primarily but they're starting to do some analys.

And piper as well. So it trying to get that. And then the last one that were particularly interested in two is grain fiber and that's where, David's helping us a lot looking at. Not the Korean quality looking at protein content within the green and so once we have all that data we put it in this database called grin global and so you can look that up.

So it's it's a publicly available database. And all of that information is going to be available to you all just type in grid GRIN Look slash global and then search and you can search through all these different accessions and find I think we've included about 10,000 data points into the database at this point.

And we're hoping to get, you know, every successive year, more data from more locations, that would be applicable to specific reading program. Local reading programs. So that's kind of how our documenting the evaluation work that we're doing. And then finally, for distribution, you can also go to grid global and request your plasma.

If operates in a similar somewhat similar fashion to Amazon, where you have a cart, you can go through see which obsessions are available through them, in your cart and then check out. And in several weeks to months, depending on seat availability, you can receive some of those seeds and again, that those seeds should only be available to like research groups, right?

So not like local gardeners, or you want to have a couple plants in your back room or something in the basement? It's it's for a research use. That's a That's where. That's how you can request your impossible. Feel free to get in. Touch with me later today. My email is Tyler.Gordon at USDA.gov and I can help you navigate the grand system if you'd like to know more about it, and I can also put you in contact with my colleague, Zack, stencil music curator, and then one other thing, I wanted to point out, we are doing some reading work in Geneva as well.

That's kind of my framework primary duty and so one of the major traits that I'm looking at is regular heart compliance. So we do have, we do have him at our facility that has THC levels that exceed 0.3% but those excessions we cannot distribute as I mentioned previously. And so what I'm trying to do is it back cross those individuals with some Areas that do have regular query compliant trait, and yeah.

When you say the thing they have At what county because most of the rights have over post. All the type 3 writings, have over 20% of 18, at some point and, and what's required by the USDA testing. In the final rule, is that it has less than 2% PhD at the pre-hearted effect.

Yes. So, we're following that rule. I mean, where you guys today, we also follow Yeah, so we I mean what we're doing is we're going for flowering and then we test six weeks after that, that's the test. Three weeks. Wind flowering starts to six weeks after that. Yes. Or we're liking for a cannabinoid.

Yep. That'll oftentimes they do. Yep. So that's whatever. And is that is that by the legislation you guys can't change that. You're not allowed to change those rules to because of the farmer, I could test earlier. I'm not going to test something and then harvest. It six weeks later I'm going to test something harvesting before 30 days of time.

Haha. So you're you're wondering can we just change when we test? We don't really want to do that. At this point, We're trying to keep everything very standardized, so we can get data across these different locations. But at some point, we could do something like that. You know, if there's a specific accession that somebody was interested in, we could look at different time points, The if the USAK does that we'll even stop that.

Start releasing that stuff. Before you water it down, You're right? Yeah. So if you ask me, I see what you're saying, but we would, we could make new germ plant. So that germ plasma. It's not like we're going to change the entire set of germ plasm that we have available, right?

We'll just take us upset of that, maybe two or three seeds, so that we can have some of that background available to different respirators. That sound good. Okay, but I don't want to speak for you part of the fact that So, Lowering the threshold in the EHT in the sink unit back upwards.

That's over here. We'll make that jump on the yes, yes. And there would be a lot more accessions that or we already have in house. That would be available if that threshold got one. So let's say one person I was the scariest on those decisions that were testing above.

What level were they testing? Going forward. I think there would be a different level that regulation could be changed to to accept those assessments or just overall general limit that we want to be running into crops going on. So we have. So our kind of goal is to diversity more.

I think we want to have as many diverse lines as possible. We're not really. So as far as like advising from a regulatory standpoint I don't I don't really want to get out of them and say like where that threshold should be. We see Many of our questions are below.

But some of marijuana we have, and we accept that. But we won't give them back. Real. 3:30. Angle that character there.

The various priorities.

Yeah, so it's tough, right? I mean, because so within each accession, we we don't know the exact level of heteroid community, we are going to start doing some sequencing work. So we can get that number unit down. We've heard some reports, it might be great. Like that with the genome.

And so we're at truck. So we are trying to maintain the diversity with indexes. So we're drawing out as many plants as we can when we do an increase which is oftentimes about 30 ants, and we don't know if we're capturing everything yet, but that's our goal. And so, when we do the increases in greenhouse, we're targeting about 30% to make up.

So we're every generation, we're gonna lose probably a little bit. Parents. If people get them to us. Yeah, yeah. So that's, that's That's fun though. It's a good traveling. Yeah, there are. Yeah. So that's kind of the overview of the USDA camp conservation and German plaza inflection. If you have questions, let me know now or later during lunch, or feel free to email me, but appreciate the tenderness today, this, this material is coming from USD.

You also have a field, right? We have a, what? I feel good We have. Well, it's actually hope so or located with Cornell and so Cornell has a field day that we purchased. But you are well, people are. Welcome to visit us. Any time Doesn't have so. Field day, August 10th.

There's another one in September. Of course, that's it. That was I was just

Okay, you thank you. Thank you. All right, thank you very much. That was very interesting. Appreciate it. Okay, we're gonna switch stairs and talk about other sources of seeds. So, forgiving give you the new microphone as I just wanted some batteries. So this is corporate mid tough. He works with like warehouse of nobody US and he has been supplying us with this very interesting fiber, especially variety things.

We've got right about the grass. That's about how that works about how we cover working with international relations and have industry. Thanks baby. Yeah, thank you. It's wanted to be here. Thanks to turn out. Really happy to see everybody and the interest in here and Share some insight on these.

Just give you a kind of a quick background like David said, warehouse back into 2016. I was living in Europe for about 11 years. I knew that the 2018 farm bill is gonna be taking place pretty soon. So I tried to get a jump on the industry and tried to source out some good seeds.

I knew Europe had been working on them so I traveled to various breeders over there. I ended up going to France to the cooperative to vote for which is now himpit. They rebranded themselves back in 2017. And so I found that the French were there. The biggest breeder in the oldest breeder in the Western world.

So I thought they had some of the best seeds and I speak a little bit of French. And so I had a little bit of inside into their culture into their language and I had a French partner at the time who introduced me to the cooper. I'm in the international sort of business.

Mostly what? We do. We're part of where the North American distributors for the, for hemp it. We're also a partnership with a company out that checked republic Hannah. Gabrielova, I've worked with out of the check republic, so she's part of my group and just last week, I'm really excited that we just signed a partnership with Ukrainian him even though the wars gone on over there, they have it.

Quit their hemp business so they're still producing the seeds as well as machinery. So now I'm starting to carry the line of dully. The the French students, but also the training and genetics. We've also got some Ukrainian equipment for sale now, which is a really good price based off old Russian technology from the 20s.

Heavy duty machines, a lot of less moving parts to them so they can handle the toughness of the hemp and not break down so easily, but we've also got not only that we have the primary decorticator but we've got a number of secondary processors. Basically hip goes through sort of a primary process and a secondary process only makes the only the primary deportators will sort of give you long fibers to three or four feet and length.

Then you got to run the hem through the bass fiber through a secondary processor. And then you get down to the millimeters, 10 millimeters, 20 millimeters, 30 millimeters. And that's what most of the companies work with. So, if anybody's interested, I can tell more about that for the later on just to get kind of a brief sort of history lesson, very quick, very rapid just kind of understand of kind of where we're coming from.

I'm trying to bring the European techniques and farming practices from Europe, over to America, because the friendship been working with French for thousands of years. A hundreds of years and it has never stopped it. The history books, tell us that the French got their seeds from the Persians. They brought it over from the, from Far, East from from China, on the Silk Road and they brought them to Romania.

Hungary check republic. Italy. When the when the Silk Road shut down with one of the wards, it's kind of when we call it. The first Renaissance took off the Venetian Sailors needed a good quality of hint fiber for their boat production for their sales and for their ropes. And so the Italians really started doing some really interesting breeding programs with it.

The French caught on, they had a big naval fleet. So they also needed the the good hemp seed and so during the sort of Italian and French Renaissance, they really started kind of put a, their sort of print their hemp breeding into production, just a little slide and it was really interesting.

The, the Venetians in the, the shipbuilders they were taking all of the, the sales for the hemp and all the excess pieces, were the artists would go and get it. Then, the they were taking, they were most of the artists at the time were painting on Frisco's. And, and using sort of egg whites to paint on board and on plaster, and they realized that hip fabric canvas was the best to paint on.

And so, when you sort of look at rim brands, or leader DaVinci's or even the Vanguard, they were all planted. They're all painting on hemp fiber. And if you look at the, the the meaning of the word, the the canvas comes from the old French candy bar, which is sort of canvas cannabis.

So it's basically can canvas actually goes back to painting on him, can't kind of this. And so the, the reason where David was just over there a couple weeks ago is in the lure valley, that's where the hip readers are there. And just kind of understand that the sort of how popular, and how big of a place that was back during the French Renaissance, that's where all the kings.

And then the Lords were living on the luau tour was sort of known as sort of. It was the first capital of France and so wouldn't tell Napoleon and I believe my French history. Place changed the capital back to Paris but it was tour. And so, sort of when the war valley is where, where we breed of the seeds, it's quite fertile soil.

Very similar to here. Very sandy It's got a good growing region and so they've been growing this same seed on the same fields for hundreds of years and these breeding programs and these farmers. I go and visit their farms right now. They've been in the family for one hundred, two hundred years.

We're dealing with sort of four, five, six, seven generations, of farmers. Have been growing this. I've been trying to get some of their best farming practices. I go over there every year and try to sort of learn more from them and interesting enough. They would be sending us. There is kind of the port that's on the sort of end of the war.

That was sort of got some of the biggest boat, building docks still to this day. And it's always been like that after the, the French Renaissance sort of go back, go forward a hundred years, no polling and bond apart his, his admiral building Villanova, he wanted to continue a big push on on the hip.

So in the fields, there in the luau, sort of in the bone for on Bali region, you can still see the canals where they have. Because the polling and wanted to make sure they were continuing to grow their hip and sort of there's a big sort of debate, you know, it needs water for the first three to five weeks to turn it from sort of the germination sex stage.

The seedling states know, it's really important and Napoleon actually needed to make sure that his water was being. The water was a watering his implant so he can make the rope and build his neighbor fleet and do his conquering. So we'll talk a little bit about sort of mention that hemped seeds.

They're in the luau valley. It's it's, it's a good growing region and the they've they've been working on a quite a while, trying to perfect it. They're all into Manish's plants. They sort of try to put between sort of like, two to three percent males on every single one of their plans they're like her nephidites in terms of sort of economic plan, they've realized that money issues is the way to go.

Want to do across this thing. Unless you're growing like a high value, high grade textile or technical fiber, then they'll grow it throughout without the dual crop. But for now, it's all about getting sort of multiple products from the same plant. They realized that Manishes plants a little bit harder to breed, but they realize that the stand and the uniformity is better when you sort of have that money issues.

It's also when you have them densely populated that you get, the pollen is able to sort of spread evenly throughout the right in the middle of the field. And and so they sort of have the the those that breathing practice took a couple notes down. Let me just say that.

The big thing I believe with with the hippity is it's it's certified it's certified not through iOS good but it's certified that OECD we find for like an economic model. It's important to get certified seed because we know what we're going to get every year. We know the germination is going to be you know as it says it is on the on the stamp and from sort of the business perspective it's important that we're getting the same germination every year, but also it's important that we're getting the same type of fiber every single year and the same characteristics of every single plant sort of a case study sort of one of my oldest clients.

I first started working with back in 2018. 2019 is hemp wood. So they're out of Murray Kentucky, I'm about about 45 minutes an hour from them, we've been growing Futura 83 that you saw today and they've realized that it it, the certified sea, they've grown to Chinese seeds, but it's the germination is different every year but with the certified seed, Can kind of trade their business model and get sort of the same yields here after year after year.

And so, I'm really happy to say that this year that the state of Kentucky has has come up with a new list, with some seeds and they put future at eight and three on the list. So that now in the state of Kentucky, if, if you grow future 83, and if you have a contract in the state gives out farmer and extra $200 on top of whatever the the producers the hemp woods gonna pay.

So it's really sort of important on that aspect. We found that the biggest problem right now is finding farmers to to grow him back in 2016. 2018 people ask me. Oh, you CBD, I never got into CBD business. I've been kind of concentrated on fiber and grain from the from the very beginning because I thought that's where it was.

And so, but now that I'm seeing that there, Farmers that are sort of hesitant as to sort of not wanting to grow because a lot of their friends are themselves. Got burned big time on the CBD and and they don't want to grow it. I'm top of that. The price of other commodities that there's just not the price of what sort of corn and what beans are getting right now we just can't compete.

What hempwood was saying was that they set up this facility in Kentucky but they couldn't get the 500 acres, you know, within the hundred miles to grow it. And so I think that's really important. Now, another commissioners here, you know, try to get like a state initiative to sort of help kind of a subsidy to sort of put that extra a couple hundred dollars on the crop to sort of kind of give that incentive to sort of compete with some of the other crops.

Another David wanted to talk to me a little bit about sort of international partnerships and how it works. I just kind of took down some numbers I kind of wanted to share because the French business is business has been in the industry for so long. I just kind of broke it down what their market is and we can kind of base our own market because they laugh at us when we tell them like what are you saying about?

You know, we say hem Creek like our heard is our biggest product and actually they laugh about it. They say, you know, how can you make money off the hurt? You know, it's just not, it's for them, it's a waste product. Like they're made product is is the best fiber and they use 50 56% of their best fiber.

Goes into the paper industry and in France, it makes them very good paper. So, 56% goes to paper, they use 29% for insulation, 9% goes to biosource plastic and the other six is Gets and the biggest market is the textile and they're trying to sort of move into the into that.

It's it's more of a specialized but it's now it's becoming sort of more popular. The second commodity that they sell is is the seed. It's like I said they're dual cropping all these for the most part and 84% of it goes to animal feed mostly bird seed and fish food.

Instead they're using that, they 15% of it, is going to human consumption and one percent goes to the cosmetic industry, they're at least a price mark on the on the hip products is the best fiber of excuse me. The the chives or the hers, 50% of that in France, they sell to animal bedding.

Mostly to the equine sector, 20% of it, goes to mulching in the garden sector. It's a good mulch. You can find it in the local, you know, Home Depots and garden stores. They sell bags of him. There and then 14% of it goes to him treat. And so that's why the French ask us to how can your how can your industry survive on the on the herd industry alone because that's one of their least sort of economical viable products that they're making from this.

And so we're really, I'm just trying to sort of educate people and try to figure out, you know, what sort of, you know, works and what they can sell, people call me. And they say, you know, I want to go him. The first thing they, I ask is what other crops you growing because this is a row property.

At the end of the day. We try to paint this evening, the ground and we don't touch it until harvest with the most part we use machines. No, manual. Labor. And that. And so I'm we're We're about a sort of see what crop they. They they're growing first because this is a row crop.

So you need the right machinery to do it. And then the second question, I ask is what marketing you going for. It seems like a lot of people are kind of working backwards, forge backwards. In other words, you know, instead of they say wanna grow him. But first thing is, you should ask yourself is what do you want to grow him for and then you sort of figure out the variety and kind of work your way backwards.

One of the things that I've noticed in my other business I've been getting into which is a part of the Ukrainian him, is they own a pulping company to pack a colon Germany and we're opening up trying to open up some of those facilities here in America but the idea of the pulp, we like the best fiber and we've been looking at a lot of the the different fibers under the electron microscope and the CBD varieties and the Asian varieties.

Just don't compare to the French bronze. And I'm just not saying that because I so the French What the point I'm trying to get across is different hemp. Varieties have different fiber things from sort of like a rough textile or not a sort of like a textile for like or you've got to find sort of textiles but you've also got a whole other textile which is for like more like a practice base like industrial fibers and things like that.

And so your fibers that are coming off some of the like today. We looked at future, 83, Lucas, 76, and 5479 the Fib or 79 and the mucus, 76, those are, like, kind of would be considered like a high-end high value fiber. Look at those, in the microscope. There's, it's ultra fine of these strands, and you'll notice that we're finding that, even some of them have sort of nanophibles capability to them.

So, what we're talking about with some of these Varieties of this fiber is that the finest. And so, when we start looking at carbon fiber, we start looking at fiber glass. You start measuring those, and we try to sort of match, sort of the instead of using synthetic fibers.

We're trying to find the natural fibers that hit those same specs as what they're using off the the synthetic fibers. Now the feature 83, which is kind of our workhorse, which is our power horse. It's it's sort of a lesser finer, less less tensile strength, but they're still quite a bit of a fiber built in to that.

And so, yeah, I think it's just important to pick the right variety for the right purpose and get the right farming practices. Questions. Yes. Tasting, do they do? Friends with Yes. So a lot of the hemp that's grown in France has grown by the dairy industry. You see a lot of the dairy farmers growing him and they'll rotate it with the with, with the corn.

And they'll, they'll look rotate it. With the wheat, we're doing quite a bit of studies. I work a lot with the University of Tennessee and middle, Tennessee, state, and we're looking at some various crop rotations that's working it's fitting in within the crop rotation. Well, I believe that it's it's never gonna be a crop that's like a mainstream crop.

I think it's a gonna be always be a specialty. Crop seamless, especially club it needs to take priority and planting it's a small seed. I found that, you know, we've got to get the seed in the ground before the rains hit. And so it's got to kind of come, you know, take a little bit of priority over the corn and in the beans and when we do that we get better success.

I'm not familiar with the print system but do they have compounds available for wheat control? Yes, they do. Now that European Union has a lot of rules and we do here in America. And so a lot of the things that we can spray on the field here in America is not allowed in in Europe, and so they don't really have a huge pest problem, they do get some, they do have some things that they spray on it and it's, it's, it's with the herbicides.

It's it's all about sort of controlling your field and not letting the weeds appear there in the first place. They the, the hip farmers over there. They've got cover crops specifically made for the hemp industry, and so they try to get a cover crop down before they're gonna plant that him to help sort of take out some of that.

So they use a lot of different techniques. They also use a lot of the false seed bed technique, which we did with the practice here, much in America, but they're really worked out filled the first two weeks, the French say that that the most the five weeks of growing hemp is the most important.

Two weeks of four planning camp and three weeks. After you've got a really worked that seed that, you know, do like a fine till you know, they don't do it deep till but they'll tell it a couple inches on the ground and they'll do that two or three times the two weeks before.

So they'll make sure that they get a clean feedback. They'll let all of the the weeds come up a couple of you know two or three generations of those weeds come up first to get them on, get them growing moaned down to them back in there, and then, and then start over and then they plant their head.

And then after they planted, they say that the first three weeks afterwards. Like, if they don't get the water and the moisture, then they'll cut that crop, if they the french farmers, they've been going so long. If they don't have a good stand after three weeks, they'll mow it down, and they'll plant something else because they missed it, they missed that point.

And so they should have a backup plan. I think we're running kind of post on time so I'll be around for questions. We are Thank you, Courtney. Really appreciate that. Yeah, he has a great wealth of dogs. I think a lot of us don't, we are going to have lunch at one o'clock.

Want to give you a chance to walk the field. You can ask where the questions others questions, please feel free to do. So, we have an announcement, you already had one, right? If you do wonder over their food will be out in about 10 minutes, if you're done, walking through the field.

Okay, thanks, I'm joining McMain. I'm, I talk to I'm an associate editor on the egg roll systems gel, scientists and environmental journal, which is part of the American society of agronomy and we're special hemp issue. So any researchers who are thinking about publishing your hemp research, please get that.

You will see the announcement. I will send the announcement to some of the people here. Give me your card if you want to send it, but we really like a lot of research so that we can show that, you know, we have research going on, it's publishable, and it will be a good boost for him.

Thanks. Thank you very much. All right. So again, in about 10 minutes, food is going to be down there, back to the main road. You there was a pavilion under all the trees, there's lots of shade, it's gonna be there. We also have some displays of some fiber products.

Things can be developed from fiber, as well as some of the fibers. Take a look at it during lunch, feel free to get up, walk around. I'll be here to answer questions about our fields. If you have any, any quick questions about logistics or anything you want to leave, right?

You can do wrongly. There's gonna be very little parking there. Yeah. A couple of you might be able to those that really need to drive. Please do for those that can walk as well. Yeah, little women. The limited parking and and a thing. And so yeah.
