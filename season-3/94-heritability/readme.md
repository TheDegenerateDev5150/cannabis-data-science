# Heritability

The Cannabis Data Science Team discusses the question of what proportion of the variation in THC or CBD in cannabis is explained by the environment or random chance and what proportion may be from genetic variation. The group analyzes seed versus clone data while discussing heritability in cannabis. The team defines phenotypic variation, genetic variance, environmental variance, and heritability. The team also discusses how some populations have more genetic variation than others and that environmental variation depends on conditions and the trait in question. The group advises to select a uniform environment when conducting research and to measure as accurately and consistently as possible. The insight of the day was to not try too hard when calculating statistics and to be cautious if what you are looking for isn't readily apparent at first.
