# Heirloom Seeds

Heirloom strains of cannabis are varieties of the plant that have been passed down, often through generations, by growers. They are non-hybrid and open-pollinated, meaning they can be saved and used to grow plants that are true to the original variety. Heirloom strains often have a unique history, cultural significance, and are valued for their unique characteristics such as aroma, flavor, and effects. They are different from the hybrid and genetically modified strains which are bred for specific traits and high yield.
