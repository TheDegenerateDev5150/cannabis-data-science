# Washington State Strain Guide
# Chemotype: THC or CBD dominance
# Unique cannabinoids (terpenes we wish)
# yield
# sale price
# number of plants grown
# avg THC percent, avg CBD percent, etc. (distribution)



# Do any particular strains affect price.


# Any apparent lineages?


# What strains are available geographically?

# Cultivation analytics.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Climate:
    # - Days of Sun
    # - Temperature
    # - Cold Days

# Geography:
    # - latitude
    # - longitude
    # - elevation

# Yield
# Preferably measured in grams per meters squared.
# E.g. 450 - 500 grams per meters squared.
# Do "sativa" strains yield less on average than "indica"?
# Could this be used as a predictor?

# Grow period (preferably flowering time).
# E.g. 70 - 85 days of flowering.
# Do "sativa" strains take longer on average than "indica"?
# Could this be used as a predictor?

# Harvest analytics.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# How many harvests are various producers (in WA) getting each year? 

# balance between quality and quantity/sq ft?

# What strains are selling the best in WA?

# What are vegatation times?
