# Matching Models

The idea is that matching models could be used to recommend products similar to a given product out of a list of products given their lab results.

## Introduction

Cannabis consumers may come to prefer a certain strain, but due to the nature of cannabis cultivation, the strain may not be in stock and the consumer may ask the retailer (budtender) for a similar product / strain. The goal here is to see if statistics can be used as a tool to aid budtenders in recommending products based on statistical similarity of lab results.

## Literature Review

**Economic Theory**: If total THC and total cannabinoids becomes a poor signal of a product that a consumer may enjoy, then they may turn to other signals, such as terpene concentrations, to make product choices.

## Methodology

Use various matching models to find products similar to a given product.
